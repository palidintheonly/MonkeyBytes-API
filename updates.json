The parsing and accessing of the Reddit RSS feed within `postNewestToDiscord` hath been corrected, banishing the runtime errors that plagued our realm. We have ensured that `htmlContent` is ever a string before it is processed in `cleanHtmlContent`, thus remedying the foul `htmlContent.replace is not a function` error. Duplicate import statements were expunged to resolve the grave 'Identifier 'express' has already been declared' syntax error.\n\nFurthermore, we have affirmed that the random facts bestowed upon thee by the `/testing` pathway remain truly random. The '?? Latest Decrees' section now faithfully readeth from the sacred 'updates.json' scroll, ensuring that all proclamations are displayed to our esteemed visitors. We have also enhanced error handling and logging, fortifying our code against unforeseen misfortunes.\n\nLet it be known that the original code hath been preserved with utmost care whilst these adjustments were wrought, ensuring stability and prosperity for all who traverse our domain."
