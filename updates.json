The `/testing` endpoint now returns detailed images of these majestic creatures, complete with image dimensions and identification.\n\n2. **Noble Bot Name Generation:**\n    - The generation of bot names hath been adjusted to reflect the grace of felines, using adjectives and nouns befitting our feline companions. The new names are both playful and fitting for the medieval court.\n\n3. **Multiple Reddit Feeds and Discord Integration:**\n    - Our system now fetches posts from two distinct Reddit realms: `/r/all` and `/r/discordapp`. Each RSS feed is linked to its own Discord webhook, allowing the API to deliver fresh proclamations from both lands to their respective channels.\n\n4. **UK Unix Timestamps for Accurate Timekeeping:**\n    - UK-based Unix timestamps have been added to responses, ensuring that the passage of time is recorded with accuracy and nobility in every proclamation."
